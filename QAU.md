Karim-Muhammad: @workspace Why i am repeating same CRUD functionality in class again? why not enough with userRepository as it is? can i? which is better?

This separation of concerns is a common design pattern in web applications.

However, you can simplify your controller by directly using the methods from the [`UserRepository`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Frepository%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Frepository%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fb64c685-bbdb-4c95-88d2-a83174cc74b4%22%5D "Go to definition") class without wrapping them in additional methods.

In this refactored version, the controller methods are directly using the [`UserRepository`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Frepository%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Frepository%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fb64c685-bbdb-4c95-88d2-a83174cc74b4%22%5D "Go to definition") methods without additional wrapping. This approach is simpler and avoids redundancy.

### Which is better?

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeping the controller and repository separate maintains a clear separation of concerns. The controller handles HTTP-specific logic, while the repository handles data access logic.
- **Code Reusability**: By keeping the repository methods separate, you can reuse them in other parts of your application, such as services or other controllers.
- **Maintainability**: A clear separation makes the code easier to maintain and test.

In summary, while you can simplify the controller by directly using the repository methods, maintaining a clear separation of concerns is generally considered a better practice for larger applications.

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace how to make validation for register part? i want the best practisea and clean code

Workspace: To add validation for the [`register`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A40%7D%7D%5D%2C%2266d97a57-8853-4bae-aa1d-1a9bee31b5c0%22%5D "Go to definition") part, you can use a validation library like `Joi` or `express-validator`. Here, I'll show you how to use `express-validator` to validate the registration data. This approach keeps your code clean and follows best practices.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Install `express-validator`**:

   ```sh
   npm install express-validator
   ```

2. **Create a validation middleware**:
   Create a new file `src/features/auth/middleware/validation.ts` and add the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { body, validationResult } from "express-validator";
   import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";

   export const registerValidationRules = () => {
     return [
       body("first_name").notEmpty().withMessage("First name is required"),
       body("last_name").notEmpty().withMessage("Last name is required"),
       body("email").isEmail().withMessage("Email is invalid"),
       body("password")
         .isLength({ min: 6 })
         .withMessage("Password must be at least 6 characters long"),
     ];
   };

   export const validate = (
     req: Request,
     res: Response,
     next: NextFunction
   ) => {
     const errors = validationResult(req);
     if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
       return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
     }
     next();
   };
   ```

3. **Apply the validation middleware to the route**:
   Update the [`src/features/auth/route/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2266d97a57-8853-4bae-aa1d-1a9bee31b5c0%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/auth/route/index.ts") file to include the validation middleware:

   ```typescript
   import { Router } from "express";
   import AuthController from "../controller/auth.controller";
   import { registerValidationRules, validate } from "../middleware/validation";

   const router = Router();

   router.post(
     "/register",
     registerValidationRules(),
     validate,
     AuthController.register
   );
   router.post("/login", AuthController.login);

   export default router;

### Summary

- **Validation Middleware**: The validation logic is separated into a middleware function, keeping the controller clean.
- **Express-Validator**: Using `express-validator` ensures that the validation logic is declarative and easy to read.
- **Error Handling**: Validation errors are handled gracefully and returned to the client with appropriate status codes and messages.

This approach adheres to best practices by keeping the validation logic separate from the business logic, making the code more maintainable and easier to test.

Karim-Muhammad: Is express-validator has placeholder i can put in withmessage method?

GitHub Copilot: `express-validator` does not support placeholders directly within the [`withMessage`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e55ca2a9-84cd-4212-920b-63f8f243e299%22%5D "Go to definition") method. However, you can dynamically generate error messages using template literals or functions.

Here's how you can modify your [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e55ca2a9-84cd-4212-920b-63f8f243e299%22%5D "Go to definition") class to dynamically generate error messages:

### Updated Code

```typescript
import { body } from "express-validator";
import Validations from "../../../common/Validations";

class AuthValidations extends Validations {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  public static register() {
    return [
      body("first_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage((value, { path }) => `${path} should be a string`)
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage(
          (value, { path }) => `${path} should be between 3 and 20 characters`
        ),
      body("last_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage((value, { path }) => `${path} should be a string`)
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage(
          (value, { path }) => `${path} should be between 3 and 20 characters`
        ),
    ];
  }
}

export default AuthValidations;
```

### Explanation

- **Dynamic Error Messages**: The [`withMessage`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e55ca2a9-84cd-4212-920b-63f8f243e299%22%5D "Go to definition") method now uses a function to dynamically generate error messages. The function receives the value and the validation context, which includes the `path` (field name).
- **Template Literals**: Template literals are used to construct the error message string, incorporating the field name dynamically.

This approach ensures that your error messages are more informative and specific to the field being validated.

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace why when i am using UserSchema.statics, findByemail not in auto-complete?

Workspace: The issue with [`findByEmail`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%224e9808b9-3c7d-4ae7-a411-7ab5cb2c898c%22%5D "Go to definition") not appearing in the auto-complete is likely due to the way TypeScript infers types for Mongoose models and schemas. To ensure that TypeScript correctly infers the types, you need to explicitly define the static methods on the schema and ensure that the schema is correctly typed.

Here’s how you can ensure that [`findByEmail`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%224e9808b9-3c7d-4ae7-a411-7ab5cb2c898c%22%5D "Go to definition") is correctly recognized:

   ```typescript
   import { Schema } from "mongoose";
   import { IUserMethods, IUserModel, IUser as IUserType } from "../types";

   const UserSchema = new Schema<IUserType, IUserModel, IUserMethods>({
     first_name: {

   UserSchema.statics.findByEmail = function (email: string) {
     return this.findOne({ email });
   };

   export type IUser = IUserType;

   export default UserSchema;
   ```

2. **Ensure the model is correctly typed**:
   Make sure the model is correctly typed in [`src/features/user/model/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%224e9808b9-3c7d-4ae7-a411-7ab5cb2c898c%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/user/model/index.ts"):

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace No, when i define instance methods, `comparePassword` appeared to me in auto-complete, but static methods it is not, why?

To ensure that TypeScript correctly infers the types, you need to explicitly define the static methods on the schema and ensure that the schema is correctly typed.

Here’s how you can ensure that [`findByEmail`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2288cbd63a-5305-4545-94cf-8a5ca78579a9%22%5D "Go to definition") is correctly recognized and appears in auto-complete:

1. **Define the static method on the schema**:
   Update the [`src/features/user/model/schema.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fschema.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2288cbd63a-5305-4545-94cf-8a5ca78579a9%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/user/model/schema.ts") file to include the [`findByEmail`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2288cbd63a-5305-4545-94cf-8a5ca78579a9%22%5D "Go to definition") static method:

   ```typescript
   import { Schema } from "mongoose";
   import { IUserMethods, IUserModel, IUser as IUserType } from "../types";

   const UserSchema = new Schema<IUserType, IUserModel, IUserMethods>({
     first_name: {
       type: String,
       required: true,

2. **Ensure the model is correctly typed**:
   Make sure the model is correctly typed in [`src/features/user/model/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2288cbd63a-5305-4545-94cf-8a5ca78579a9%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/user/model/index.ts"):

   import "./methods";

   const UserModel = model<IUser, IUserModel>("User", UserSchema);

   export default UserModel;
   ```

3. **Update the [`IUserModel`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A18%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fschema.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%2C%2288cbd63a-5305-4545-94cf-8a5ca78579a9%22%5D "Go to definition") interface**:

Karim-Muhammad: why express-validator continue validate even if first validator is failed?!

GitHub Copilot: By default, `express-validator` runs all validators for a field, even if one of them fails. To stop validation after the first failure, you can use the `.bail()` method. This method tells `express-validator` to stop running further validations if the previous one has failed.

Here's how you can update your [`register`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e40f3e04-5be6-43b9-9b1e-b8c3aeab2ea2%22%5D "Go to definition") method to use `.bail()`:

### Updated Code

```typescript
import { body } from "express-validator";
import Validations from "../../../common/Validations";

class AuthValidations extends Validations {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  public static register() {
    return [
      body("first_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage(customMessage("{PATH} should be string"))
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage("{PATH} should be between 3 to 20 characters"),
      body("last_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage("{PATH} should be string")
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage("{PATH} should be between 3 to 20 characters"),
      body("email")
        .isEmail()
        .withMessage("must enter valid email")
        .bail()
        .custom(async (email) => {
          return await this.isEmailTaken(email);
        }),

      body("password").isStrongPassword({ returnScore: true }),

      body("mobile").optional().isMobilePhone("ar-EG"),
    ];
  }
}

export default AuthValidations;
```

### Explanation

- **`.bail()` Method**: The `.bail()` method is added after each validation step. This ensures that if a validation step fails, the subsequent validations for that field are not executed.
- **Field-Specific**: The `.bail()` method is applied to each field individually, so if [`first_name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e40f3e04-5be6-43b9-9b1e-b8c3aeab2ea2%22%5D "Go to definition") validation fails, it won't affect the validation of [`last_name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e40f3e04-5be6-43b9-9b1e-b8c3aeab2ea2%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`email`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A25%2C%22character%22%3A23%7D%7D%5D%2C%22e40f3e04-5be6-43b9-9b1e-b8c3aeab2ea2%22%5D "Go to definition"), etc.

This approach ensures that validation stops at the first failure for each field, improving performance and providing more immediate feedback on validation errors.

GitHub Copilot: The error `TS2339: Property 'validate' does not exist on type 'typeof AuthValidations'` indicates that TypeScript cannot find the `validate` method on the [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **The `validate` method is not defined in the [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class.**
2. **There might be a typo or incorrect usage of the `validate` method.**

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the `validate` method is defined in the [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class or its parent class [`Validations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition").

### Usage Example

When using the `validate` method in your routes, ensure it’s called correctly:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import AuthValidations from "./path/to/AuthValidations";

const router = express.Router();

router.post(
  "/register",
  AuthValidations.register(),
  AuthValidations.validate,
  (req, res) => {
    // Handle registration logic here
    res.send("User registered successfully");
  }
);

export default router;
```

### Summary

- **Define `validate` Method**: Ensure the `validate` method is defined in the [`Validations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class or directly in the [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class.
- **Correct Usage**: Use the `validate` method correctly in your routes to handle validation results.

This approach ensures that the `validate` method is available and correctly used in your [`AuthValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22fbb4f3fb-512c-48f1-bb45-2325fab266e9%22%5D "Go to definition") class.

}
```

### Explanation

1. **Async/Await**: Use `async/await` for better readability and error handling.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - If the email is taken, throw a new [`ErrorAPI`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A49%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%225e9b145b-207e-4e01-84fc-b834c980b915%22%5D "Go to definition") instance with a custom message and status code.
   - If any other error occurs, check if it is an instance of [`ErrorAPI`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A49%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%225e9b145b-207e-4e01-84fc-b834c980b915%22%5D "Go to definition"). If it is, rethrow it. Otherwise, throw [`ErrorAPI.badRequest`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A49%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%225e9b145b-207e-4e01-84fc-b834c980b915%22%5D "Go to definition") with the error message.

      if (document) {
        throw new ErrorAPI("This email is invalid", 404);
      }
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      if (error instanceof ErrorAPI) {
        throw error;
      } else {
        throw ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message);
      }
    }
  }
}

export default new AuthValidations();
```

This approach ensures that the [`ErrorAPI`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A49%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%225e9b145b-207e-4e01-84fc-b834c980b915%22%5D "Go to definition") is thrown directly when the email is taken, and other errors are handled appropriately.

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace can we create function for that or pattern to make code more clean and small?

Workspace: Yes, you can refactor the error handling logic into a separate function to make the code cleaner and more maintainable. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a utility function for error handling**:
   Create a function that handles the error and throws the appropriate [`ErrorAPI`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FValidations.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%2C%22bcae310a-b39e-4e42-988d-1ee54315751d%22%5D "Go to definition") instance.

2. **Use the utility function in your [`isEmailTaken`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A30%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22bcae310a-b39e-4e42-988d-1ee54315751d%22%5D "Go to definition") method**:
   Replace the inline error handling with a call to the utility function.

Here's how you can implement this:

### Step 1: Create a Utility Function

Create a utility function in a common file, such as [`src/common/helpers.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2Fhelpers.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22bcae310a-b39e-4e42-988d-1ee54315751d%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/common/helpers.ts"):

```typescript
// src/common/helpers.ts
import ErrorAPI from "./ErrorAPI";

export function handleError(error: any) {
  if (error instanceof ErrorAPI) {
    throw error; // Re-throw the ErrorAPI instance
  }
  throw ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message); // Wrap other errors in ErrorAPI

```typescript
import { body } from "express-validator";
import Validations from "../../../common/Validations";
import { customMessage, handleError } from "../../../common/helpers";
import UserModel from "../../user/model";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";

class AuthValidations extends Validations {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  public register() {
    return [
      body("first_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage(customMessage("should be string"))
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage("should be between 3 to 20 characters"),
      body("last_name")
        .isString()
        .withMessage("should be string")
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 20 })
        .withMessage("should be between 3 to 20 characters"),
      body("email")
        .isEmail()
        .withMessage("must enter valid email")
        .bail()
        .custom(async (email) => {
          return await this.isEmailTaken(email);
        }),

      body("password")
        .isStrongPassword({ returnScore: true })
        .withMessage(
          "should be strong password(uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)"
        )
        .bail(),
      body("mobile").optional().isMobilePhone("ar-EG"),

      this.validate(),
    ];
  }

  public isEmailTaken(email: string) {
    return UserModel.findByEmail(email)
      .then((document) => {
        console.log(document);
        if (document) throw ErrorAPI.notFound("This email is invalid");
        return true;
      })
      .catch(handleError);
  }
}

export default new AuthValidations();
```

### Step 3: Update Other Methods (Optional)

If you have other methods with similar error handling logic, you can also update them to use the `handleError` function. For example, in [`src/features/auth/controller/auth.controller.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22bcae310a-b39e-4e42-988d-1ee54315751d%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/auth/controller/auth.controller.ts"):

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import UserRepository from "../../user/repository";
import { apiResponse, handleError } from "../../../common/helpers";

class UserController {
  private readonly userRepository: UserRepository;
  constructor() {
    this.userRepository = new UserRepository();
  }

  register = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    try {
      await this.userRepository.create(req.body);

      return apiResponse(res, 201, "User Created Successfully!");
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(error);
    }
  };

  login = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    try {
      const { email, password } = req.body;
      const user = await this.userRepository.readOne({ email });
      if (!user || !(await user.compare

Password

(password))) {
        throw Error("Invalid Credentials!");
      }

      return res.status(200).json({
        data: {
          message: "Login Successfully!",
        },
      });
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(error);
    }
  };

  profile = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    try {
      // const profileData = await this.userRepository.readOne()
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(error);
    }
  };

  logout = async () => {};
}

export default new UserController();
```

By following these steps, you can make your code cleaner and more maintainable by centralizing the error handling logic in a single utility function.

Karim-Muhammad: geenreate a secret key from crypto

GitHub Copilot: To generate a secret key using the `crypto` module in Node.js, you can use the following script. This script will generate a random secret key and print it to the console.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Import the `crypto` module**.
2. **Generate a random secret key** using `crypto.randomBytes`.
3. **Convert the random bytes to a hexadecimal string**.
4. **Print the secret key** to the console.

### Code

Create a new file, e.g., `generateSecretKey.js`, and add the following code:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Generate a random secret key
const secretKey = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('

hex

');

console.log(`Generated Secret Key: ${secretKey}`);
```

### Run the Script

To run the script and generate the secret key, use the following command in the terminal:

```sh
node generateSecretKey.js
```

This will output a generated secret key, which you can then copy and paste into your [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2214c95d63-0025-44ba-9522-bb80c76db3f7%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/.env") file under the [`SECRET_KEY`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%2C%2214c95d63-0025-44ba-9522-bb80c76db3f7%22%5D "Go to definition") variable.

### Step 1: Extend the [`Request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "Go to definition") Interface

Create a new file named `express.d.ts` in your [`src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src") directory (or any other appropriate directory) to extend the [`Request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "Go to definition") interface:

```typescript
// src/express.d.ts
import { IUserDocument } from "./features/user/types";

declare module "express-serve-static-core" {
  interface Request {
    user?: IUserDocument;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json")

Ensure that your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src") directory in the `typeRoots` or `include` array so that TypeScript can recognize the custom type definitions:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Extended [`Request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "Go to definition") Interface in Guard Middleware

Now, you can use the extended [`Request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "Go to definition") interface in your guard middleware:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/middleware/guard.middleware.ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import AuthServices from "../service/jwt.services";
import UserRepository from "../../user/repository";

class GuardMiddlewares {
  /**
   * @description Guard middleware - to be used in routes that should be guarded
   * @returns
   */
  guard() {
    return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      const authorization = req.headers.authorization;

      // 1. Check if `headers` has Authorization field
      if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith("Bearer"))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("Please login first!");

      // 2. Verify the incoming token
      const token = authorization.split(" ")[1];
      if (!token)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "un-authenticated user - there is no token!"
        );

      const payload = AuthServices.verify(token);

      // 3. Check if this token belong to some user
      const user = await new UserRepository().readOne({ id: payload.id });

      if (!user) throw ;

      Error;

      API.unauthorized("This token no longer belong to you.");

      // 4. Check if PasswordChangedAt updated than `iat` of token
      if (!user.isTokenUpToDate(payload.iat))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "Please refresh the token, then do your action again."
        );

      req.user = user;
      next();
    };
  }

  /**
   * @description Reverse the guard middleware - to be used in routes that should not be guarded
   * @returns
   */
  reverseGuard() {
    return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      if (req.headers.authorization)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("You are already logged in.");

      next();
    };
  }
}

export default new GuardMiddlewares();
```

### Step 4: Use the Guard Middleware in Routes

Now, you can use the guard middleware in your routes, and the [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%22796e0124-826b-44b4-9359-9d9bf1104b0a%22%5D "Go to definition") property will be available:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/route/index.ts
import { Router } from "express";
import AuthController from "../controller/auth.controller";
import AuthValidations from "../validation";
import guardMiddleware from "../middleware/guard.middleware";

const router = Router();

router.post(
  "/register",
  guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(),
  AuthValidations.register(),
  AuthController.register
);
router.post("/login", guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(), AuthController.login);

Here’s how you can do it:

### Step 1: Create a Custom Type Definition File

Create a new file named `express.d.ts` in your [`src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src") directory (or any other appropriate directory) to extend the `Request` interface:

```typescript
// src/express.d.ts
import { IUserDocument } from "./features/user/types";

declare module "express-serve-static-core" {
  interface Request {
    user?: IUserDocument;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json")

Ensure that your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src") directory in the `typeRoots` or `include` array so that TypeScript can recognize the custom type definitions:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 3: Use the Extended `Request` Interface in Guard Middleware

Now, you can use the extended `Request` interface in your guard middleware:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/middleware/guard.middleware.ts
import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import AuthServices from "../service/jwt.services";
import UserRepository from "../../user/repository";

class GuardMiddlewares {
  /**
   * @description Guard middleware - to be used in routes that should be guarded
   * @returns
   */
  guard() {
    return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      const authorization = req.headers.authorization;

      // 1. Check if `headers` has Authorization field
      if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith("Bearer"))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("Please login first!");

      // 2. Verify the incoming token
      const token = authorization.split(" ")[1];
      if (!token)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "un-authenticated user - there is no token!"
        );

      const payload = AuthServices.verify(token);

      // 3. Check if this token belong to some user
      const user = await new UserRepository().readOne({ id: payload.id });

      if (!user) throw ;

      Error;

      API.unauthorized("This token no longer belong to you.");

      // 4. Check if PasswordChangedAt updated than `iat` of token
      if (!user.isTokenUpToDate(payload.iat))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "Please refresh the token, then do your action again."
        );

      req.user = user;
      next();
    };
  }

  /**
   * @description Reverse the guard middleware - to be used in routes that should not be guarded
   * @returns
   */
  reverseGuard() {
    return (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      if (req.headers.authorization)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("You are already logged in.");

      next();
    };
  }
}

export default new GuardMiddlewares();
```

By following these steps, you ensure that the `Request` interface is extended to include the [`user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "Go to definition") property, and you can safely use [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%227bf338f1-7e0b-4081-b940-e4d4c7b05ff5%22%5D "Go to definition") in your guard middleware and other parts of your application.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue:

### Step 1: Ensure Correct Type Definition

Make sure your [`src/types/express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/types/express.d.ts") file correctly extends the [`Request`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") interface:

```typescript
import { IUserDocument } from "../

features/user/types";

// Extend the Request interface to include the user property
declare module "express-serve-static-core" {
  interface Request {
    user?: IUserDocument;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Update [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json")

Ensure that your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`src`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src") directory in the `typeRoots` or [`include`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") array so that TypeScript can recognize the custom type definitions:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/types"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 3: Restart TypeScript Server

Sometimes, the TypeScript server needs to be restarted to pick up the new type definitions. In Visual Studio Code, you can do this by:

1. Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
2. Typing `TypeScript: Restart TS Server` and selecting it.

### Step 4: Ensure Correct Import Order

Make sure that your custom type definitions are imported before any other imports in your [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts") or entry file:

```typescript
import "./types/express"; // Import custom type definitions first

import express, { Application } from "express";
import config from "./config";
import connectDatabase from "./database/connection";
import apps from "./features";
import morgran from "morgan";

class App {
  private app: Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }

  private setupDatabase() {
    connectDatabase();
  }
  private setupStandardMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use(express.json());
    this.app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    this.app.use("/static", express.static(`${config.static}`));
    this.app.use(morgran("dev"));
  }
  private setupRoutesMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use("/", apps);
  }

  public start() {
    this.setupDatabase();
    this.setupStandardMiddlewares();
    this.setupRoutesMiddlewares();

    return this.app;
  }
}

export default App;

### Step 5: Verify Middleware Usage

Ensure that the [`guard`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A43%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") middleware is correctly setting the [`user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A42%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") property on the [`req`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") object:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/middleware/guard.middleware.ts
import { Request, RequestHandler, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import AuthServices from "../service/jwt.services";
import UserRepository from "../../user/repository";

class GuardMiddlewares {
  guard(): RequestHandler {
    return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      const authorization = req.headers.authorization;

      if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith("Bearer"))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("Please login first!");

      const token = authorization.split(" ")[1];
      if (!token)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "un-authenticated user - there is no token!"
        );

      const payload = AuthServices.verify(token);

      const user = await new UserRepository().readOne({ id: payload.id });

      if (!user)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("This token no longer belong to you.");

      if (!user.isTokenUpToDate(payload.iat))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(

        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("You are already logged in.");

      next();
    };
  }
}

export default new GuardMiddlewares();
```

### Step 6: Use Middleware in Routes

Ensure that the middleware is used in your routes:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/route/index.ts
import { Router } from "express";
import AuthController from "../controller/auth.controller";
import AuthValidations from "../validation";
import guardMiddleware from "../middleware/guard.middleware";

const router = Router();

router.post(
  "/register",
  guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(),
  AuthValidations.register(),
  AuthController.register
);
router.post("/login", guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(), AuthController.login);

export default router;
```

### Step 7: Verify Usage in Controllers

Ensure that the [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") property is used correctly in your controllers:

```typescript
// src/features/user/controller/user.controller.ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import UserRepository from "../repository";

class UserController {
  private readonly userRepository: UserRepository;

  constructor() {
    this.userRepository = new UserRepository();
  }

  read = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.read({});

      return res.status(200).json({ data });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  readOne = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params } = req;
    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.readOne({ _id: params.id });

      return res.status(200).json({ data });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  update = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params, body } = req;

    try {
      const updatedData = await this.userRepository.update(
        { _id: params.id },
        body
      );

      return res.status(200).json({
        data: updatedData,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  delete = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params } = req;

    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.delete({ _id: params.id });

      return res.status(200).json({
        data,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  create = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { body } = req;

    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.create(body);

      return res.status(201).json({
        data,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };
}

export default new UserController();
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22002d618d-70ee-4ff1-a1f4-518b1755e74f%22%5D "Go to definition") not being recognized by TypeScript.

Karim-Muhammad: Error: Cannot find module './types/express'
Require stack:

- /run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts
- /run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/server.ts

GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that the module `./types/express` cannot be found. This is likely because the path to the custom type definition file is incorrect. Let's ensure the file exists and the path is correct.

### Step 1: Verify the File Path

Ensure that the file [`express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "Go to definition") exists in the [`src/types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/types") directory. The file should look like this:

```typescript
// src/types/express.d.ts
import { IUserDocument } from "../features/user/types";

// Extend the Request interface to include the user property
declare module "express-serve-static-core" {
  interface Request {
    user?: IUserDocument;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Correct the Import Path

Update the import path in [`app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts") to correctly reference the [`express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "Go to definition") file:

```typescript
// src/app.ts
import "./types/express"; // Ensure this path is correct
import express, { Application } from "express";
import config from "./config";
import connectDatabase from "./database/connection";

// Features
import apps from "./features";

class App {
  private app: Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }

  private setupDatabase() {
    connectDatabase();
  }

  private setupStandardMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use(express.json());
    this.app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    this.app.use("/static", express.static(`${config.static}`));
  }

  private setupRoutesMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use("/", apps);
  }

  public start() {
    this.setupDatabase();
    this.setupStandardMiddlewares();
    this.setupRoutesMiddlewares();

    return this.app;
  }
}

export default App;
```

### Step 3: Verify [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json")

Ensure that your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`src/types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22115015e8-fa9d-4846-80d4-a5ddc2c65f62%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/types") directory in the `typeRoots` or `include` array:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/types"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 4: Restart TypeScript Server

Restart the TypeScript server in Visual Studio Code:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
2. Type `TypeScript: Restart TS Server` and select it.

### Step 5: Rebuild and Run the Application

Rebuild and run your application to ensure the changes take effect:

```bash
# Clean the build directory (if applicable)
rm -rf dist

# Build the project
tsc

# Run the application
node dist/server.js
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the custom type definitions and ensure that `req.user` is recognized by TypeScript.

The correct path should be `../types/express` since [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2278d947bd-09f0-4147-b4c9-580632b05e99%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts") is one level deeper than the [`types`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A48%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2278d947bd-09f0-4147-b4c9-580632b05e99%22%5D "Go to definition") directory.

Here's how you can fix the import in [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2278d947bd-09f0-4147-b4c9-580632b05e99%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts")

:

```typescript

import morgran from "morgan";

import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

import "../types/express"; // Corrected import path
import config from "../config";
import connectDatabase from "../database";

// Features
import apps from "./features";

class App {
  private app: Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();

    this.setupDatabase();
    this.setupStandardMiddlewares();
    this.setupRoutesMiddlewares();

    return this.app;
  }
}

export default new App();
```

This should resolve the module not found error.

Workspace: To ensure that TypeScript recognizes the custom type definitions in [`types/express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types/express.d.ts"), you need to make sure that the type definitions are correctly included in your project and that the import paths are correct. Here are the steps to ensure this:

### Step 1: Correct the Import Path in [`types/express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types/express.d.ts")

Since [`types/express.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types/express.d.ts") is in the [`types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types") directory, the import path for [`IUserDocument`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Ftypes%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A17%7D%7D%5D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "Go to definition") should be adjusted to reflect the correct relative path:

```typescript
import { IUserDocument } from "../src/features/user/types";

declare module "express-serve-static-core" {
  interface Request {
    user?: IUserDocument;
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Ensure [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") Includes the [`types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types") Directory

Make sure your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/types") directory in the `typeRoots` or `include` array so that TypeScript can recognize the custom type definitions:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./types"]
  },
  "include": ["src", "types"]
}
```

### Step 3: Import the Custom Type Definitions in [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts")

Ensure that your custom type definitions are imported at the top of your [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts") file:

```typescript
import "../types/express"; // Import custom type definitions first

import express, { Application } from "express";
import morgran from "morgan";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

import config from "../config";
import connectDatabase from "../database";

// Features
import apps from "./features";

class App {
  private app: Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }

  private setupDatabase() {
    connectDatabase();
  }
  private setupStandardMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use(express.json());
    this.app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    this.app.use("/static", express.static(`${config.static}`));
    this.app.use(morgran("dev"));
  }
  private setupRoutesMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use("/", apps);
  }

  public start() {
    this.setupDatabase();
    this.setupStandardMiddlewares();
    this.setupRoutesMiddlewares();

    return this.app;
  }
}

export default new App();
```

### Step 4: Restart TypeScript Server

Sometimes, the TypeScript server needs to be restarted to pick up the new type definitions. In Visual Studio Code, you can do this by:

1. Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
2. Typing `TypeScript: Restart TS Server` and selecting it.

### Step 5: Verify Middleware Usage

Ensure that the middleware is correctly setting the [`user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftypes%2Fexpress.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A42%7D%7D%5D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "Go to definition") property on the [`req`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%5D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "Go to definition") object:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/middleware/guard.middleware.ts
import { Request, RequestHandler, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import AuthServices from "../service/jwt.services";
import UserRepository from "../../user/repository";

class GuardMiddlewares {
  guard(): RequestHandler {
    return async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      const authorization = req.headers.authorization;

      if (!authorization || !authorization.startsWith("Bearer"))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("Please login first!");

      const token = authorization.split(" ")[1];
      if (!token)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "un-authenticated user - there is no token!"
        );

      const payload = AuthServices.verify(token);

      const user = await new UserRepository().readOne({ id: payload.id });

      if (!user)
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("This token no longer belong to you.");

      if (!user.isTokenUpToDate(payload.iat))
        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized(
          "Please refresh the token, then do your action again."
        );

      req.user = user;
      next();
    };
  }

        throw ErrorAPI.unauthorized("You are already logged in.");

      next();
    };
  }
}

export default new GuardMiddlewares();
```

### Step 6: Use Middleware in Routes

Ensure that the middleware is used in your routes:

```typescript
// src/features/auth/route/index.ts
import { Router } from "express";
import AuthController from "../controller/auth.controller";
import AuthValidations from "../validation";
import guardMiddleware from "../middleware/guard.middleware";

const router = Router();

router.post(
  "/register",
  guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(),
  AuthValidations.register(),
  AuthController.register
);
router.post("/login", guardMiddleware.reverseGuard(), AuthController.login);

export default router;

### Step 7: Verify Usage in Controllers

Ensure that the [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%2C%2243ecfd36-324e-4dad-b230-c0b71259ae72%22%5D "Go to definition") property is used correctly in your controllers:

```typescript
// src/features/user/controller/user.controller.ts
import { Request, Response } from "express";
import ErrorAPI from "../../../common/ErrorAPI";
import UserRepository from "../repository";

class UserController {
  private readonly userRepository: UserRepository;

  constructor() {
    this.userRepository = new UserRepository();
  }

  read = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.read({});

      return res.status(200).json({ data });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  readOne = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params } = req;
    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.readOne({ _id: params.id });

      return res.status(200).json({ data });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  update = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params, body } = req;

    try {
      const updatedData = await this.userRepository.update(
        { _id: params.id },
        body
      );

      return res.status(200).json({
        data: updatedData,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  delete = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { params } = req;

    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.delete({ _id: params.id });

      return res.status(200).json({
        data,
      });
    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };

  create = async (req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
    const { body } = req;

    try {
      const data = await this.userRepository.create(body);

      return res.status(201).json({

    } catch (error) {
      next(ErrorAPI.badRequest(error.message));
    }
  };
}

export default new UserController();
```

To resolve this,

ensure that your custom type definitions are correctly set up and included in your project. Here are the steps to ensure this:

### Step 1: Correct the Custom Type Definition

Ensure that your custom type definition file [`src/@types/express/index.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Fexpress%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22a2b3c4d5-6789-0123-4567-89abcdef0123%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/@types/express/index.d.ts") is correctly defined:

```typescript
import { IUserDocument } from "../../features/user/types";

declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      user?: IUserDocument;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Ensure [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") Includes the Custom Types Directory

Make sure your [`tsconfig.json`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/tsconfig.json") includes the [`src/@types`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/@types") directory in the [`typeRoots`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%5D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "Go to definition") or [`include`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftsconfig.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "Go to definition") array:

    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "target": "es6",
    "moduleResolution": "node",

    "outDir": "dist",
    "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/@types"]
  },

}
```

### Step 3: Import the Custom Type Definitions in Your Application

Ensure that your custom type definitions are imported at the top of your main application file [`src/app.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fapp.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22a2b3c4d5-6789-0123-4567-89abcdef0123%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/app.ts"):

```typescript
import "../@types/express"; // Import custom type definitions first

import express, { Application } from "express";
import morgran from "morgan";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

import config from "../config";
import connectDatabase from "../database";

// Features
import apps from "./features";

class App {
  private app: Application;

  constructor() {
    this.app = express();
  }

  private setupDatabase() {
    connectDatabase();
  }
  private setupStandardMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use(express.json());
    this.app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    this.app.use("/static", express.static(`${config.static}`));
    this.app.use(morgran("dev"));
  }
  private setupRoutesMiddlewares() {
    this.app.use("/", apps);
  }

  public start() {
    this.setupDatabase();
    this.setupStandardMiddlewares();
    this.setupRoutesMiddlewares();

    return this.app;
  }
}

export default new App();
```

### Step 4: Restart TypeScript Server

Sometimes, the TypeScript server needs to be restarted to pick up the new type definitions. In Visual Studio Code, you can do this by:

1. Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette.
2. Typing `TypeScript: Restart TS Server` and selecting it.

### Step 5: Verify Middleware Usage

Ensure that the middleware is correctly setting the [`user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Fexpress%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A29%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A5%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "Go to definition") property on the [`req`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A11%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FErrorHandler.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "Go to definition") object:

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with [`req.user`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22992b353d-a63b-40a7-854f-3adb4d149db6%22%5D "Go to definition") not being recognized by TypeScript.

Karim-Muhammad: isStrongPassword is accept this password "AM2" !!!

GitHub Copilot: The [`isStrongPassword`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%2298fac5ee-2466-486d-82ff-5d1f4b356805%22%5D "Go to definition") function from the `validator` library is used to validate whether a password is strong based on certain criteria. By default, it checks for the following:

- Minimum length of 8 characters
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one symbol

If the password "AM2" is being accepted, it means the default criteria might have been overridden or not applied correctly.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Check the [`isStrongPassword`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%2298fac5ee-2466-486d-82ff-5d1f4b356805%22%5D "Go to definition") Configuration**: Ensure that the [`isStrongPassword`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%2298fac5ee-2466-486d-82ff-5d1f4b356805%22%5D "Go to definition") function is being used with the correct configuration.
2. **Update the Configuration**: If necessary, update the configuration to enforce stricter rules.
3. **Test the Function**: Verify that the function correctly validates passwords according to the updated criteria.

### Example Code

Here's an example of how to use [`isStrongPassword`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%2298fac5ee-2466-486d-82ff-5d1f4b356805%22%5D "Go to definition") with custom configuration:

```typescript
import { isStrongPassword } from "validator";

const password = "AM2";

// Custom configuration for isStrongPassword
const options = {
  minLength: 8,
  minLowercase: 1,
  minUppercase: 1,
  minNumbers: 1,
  minSymbols: 1,
};

const isValid = isStrongPassword(password, options);

console.log(`Is the password "${password}" strong? ${isValid}`);
```

### Explanation

- **minLength**: Minimum length of the password.
- **minLowercase**: Minimum number of lowercase letters.
- **minUppercase**: Minimum number of uppercase letters.
- **minNumbers**: Minimum number of numeric characters.
- **minSymbols**: Minimum number of special characters (symbols).

### Testing

Ensure that the password "AM2" does not meet the criteria:

```typescript
const password = "AM2";
const isValid = isStrongPassword(password, options);
console.log(`Is the password "${password}" strong? ${isValid}`); // Should print: false
```

By following these steps, you can ensure that the [`isStrongPassword`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fvalidation%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A52%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%2298fac5ee-2466-486d-82ff-5d1f4b356805%22%5D "Go to definition") function correctly validates passwords according to the desired criteria.

This can happen if the middleware is not correctly applied or if there is an issue with the route definition.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

### Step 1: Ensure Correct Middleware Application

The middleware should be applied before the route handlers.

### Step 2: Check Route Definition

Ensure that the route definition correctly specifies the [`id`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A30%2C%22character%22%3A39%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A25%2C%22character%22%3A67%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fpackage.json%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Ftodos.md%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A19%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcommon%2Fvalidations%2Froute-validations%2FmongoId-validations.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A14%7D%7D%5D%2C%228f8b97f4-f075-45bc-9c2b-3ea83a1a445e%22%5D "Go to definition") parameter.

Workspace: The issue might be due to the order of middleware and route handlers in your router configuration. The [`req.params`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcommon%2Fvalidations%2Froute-validations%2FmongoId-validations.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A57%7D%7D%5D%2C%2216436942-4429-4668-a458-891efcfa608f%22%5D "Go to definition") object should be populated by the time it reaches your middleware, but if the middleware is not correctly placed, it might not have access to the route parameters.

In your current setup, you are using `.all("/:id")` followed by `.use(...)`. This might be causing the issue. Instead, you should directly attach the middleware to the specific routes.

Here's how you can modify your [`src/features/user/route/index.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2216436942-4429-4668-a458-891efcfa608f%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/features/user/route/index.ts") to ensure that the middleware correctly processes the route parameters:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controller/user.controller";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import MongoIdValidations from "../../common/validations/route-validations/mongoId-validations";
import UserModel from "../model";
import { IUserDocument } from "../types";

const router = Router();

router.use(guardMiddleware.adminGuard());

router.get("/", UserController.read);

router
  .route("/:id")
  .all(
    MongoIdValidations.isMongoIdValid("id"),
    MongoIdValidations.isMongoIdExist<IUserDocument>("id", UserModel)
  )
  .get(UserController.readOne)
  .put(UserController.update)
  .delete(UserController.delete)
  .post("/block", UserController.block)
  .post("/unblock", UserController.unblock);

export default router;
```

2. **Middleware Application**: Use `.all(...)` to apply the middleware to all HTTP methods for the `/:id` route.
3. **Route Handlers**: Define the specific route handlers ([`.get`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2216436942-4429-4668-a458-891efcfa608f%22%5D "Go to definition"), `.put`, `.delete`, etc.) after applying the middleware.

### Debugging Middleware

To further debug, you can add a simple middleware to log [`req.params`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcommon%2Fvalidations%2Froute-validations%2FmongoId-validations.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A57%7D%7D%5D%2C%2216436942-4429-4668-a458-891efcfa608f%22%5D "Go to definition"):

```typescript
router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("Params:", req.params);
  next();
});
```

Place this middleware before your route definitions to see if [`req.params`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fcontroller%2Fauth.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A20%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcommon%2Fvalidations%2Froute-validations%2FmongoId-validations.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A5%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fcontroller%2Fuser.controller.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A26%2C%22character%22%3A57%7D%7D%5D%2C%2216436942-4429-4668-a458-891efcfa608f%22%5D "Go to definition") is populated correctly. If it is, then the issue might be with the order of middleware and route handlers. If not, there might be an issue with how the routes are defined or how the requests are being made.

why this error?

To fix this, you need to ensure that the method's return type matches the expected type. Since [`generateAccessToken`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition") is an [`async`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition") function, it should return a `Promise<string>`. You need to update the type definition for `IUserMethods` to reflect this.

Here's how you can update the type definition and the method:

1. **Update the `IUserMethods` interface** to reflect the correct return type for [`generateAccessToken`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition").

2. **Ensure the method implementation** is correct.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Update the `IUserMethods` interface**:

```typescript
interface IUserMethods {
  comparePassword(password: string): Promise<boolean>;
  generateRefreshToken(): Promise<string>;
  generateAccessToken(): Promise<string>;
  isTokenUpToDate(tokenDate: number): boolean;
}
```

2. **Ensure the method implementation** is correct:

```typescript
import crypto from "crypto";
import bcrypt from "bcrypt";
import UserSchema from "./schema";
import JWTServices from "../../auth/service/jwt.services";
import config from "../../../../config";

UserSchema.methods.comparePassword = async function (password: string) {
  return await bcrypt.compare(password, this.password);
};

UserSchema.methods.generateRefreshToken = async function () {
  const refreshToken = JWTServices.sign(
    { id: this.id, role: this.role },
    config.refresh_key,
    "3d"
  );

  const rTknHash = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", config.refresh_key)
    .update(refreshToken)
    .digest("hex");

  this.refreshToken = rTknHash;
  await this.save();

  return refreshToken;
};

UserSchema.methods.generateAccessToken = async function () {
  const accessToken = JWTServices.sign({ id: this.id, role: this.role });
  return accessToken;
};

/**
 * @description Check if user has updated the password, if so, his token should be removed and re-freshed again.
 * @param tokenDate(iat) - number (date in seconds)
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
UserSchema.methods.isTokenUpToDate = function (tokenDate: number) {
  return this.passwordChangedAt / 1000 < tokenDate;
};

UserSchema.statics.findByEmail = async function (email) {
  return await this.findOne({ email });
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Interface Update**: The `IUserMethods` interface now correctly specifies that [`generateAccessToken`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition") returns a `Promise<string>`.
2. **Method Implementation**: The [`generateAccessToken`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition") method remains an [`async`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Fmodel%2Fmethods.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A37%7D%7D%5D%2C%2296615222-77eb-4d4c-bc42-34eb9c5c5daf%22%5D "Go to definition") function, returning a `Promise<string>`.

This should resolve the TypeScript error by ensuring that the method's return type matches the expected type.

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace Type '{ type: typeof Types.ObjectId; ref: string; }' is not assignable to type 'ObjectId | SchemaDefinitionProperty<ObjectId, IProduct>'. Types of property 'type' are incompatible. Type 'typeof ObjectId' is not assignable to type 'typeof Mixed | ObjectIdSchemaDefinition'. Type 'typeof ObjectId' is missing the following properties from type 'typeof Mixed': schemaName, cast, checkRequired, set, and 2 more.

Workspace: The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch in your Mongoose schema definition.

Karim-Muhammad: validations for create and update is almost the same, but in create required and update optional
so how to make single validation with just only differs optional or required

GitHub Copilot: To create a single validation method that can handle both required and optional fields based on whether it's for creation or update, you can add a parameter to your validation method to specify whether the fields should be required or optional. Here's how you can refactor your [`ProductValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fproducts%2Fvalidations%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%223bce9500-6277-4e46-8cd4-13e7d6c49197%22%5D "Go to definition") class to achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Add a parameter** to the [`create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fproducts%2Fvalidations%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%223bce9500-6277-4e46-8cd4-13e7d6c49197%22%5D "Go to definition") method to specify whether the fields should be required or optional.
2. **Use conditional logic** to apply the appropriate validation rules based on the parameter.

### Updated Code

```typescript
import { body } from "express-validator";
import Validations from "../../../common/Validations";

class ProductValidations extends Validations {
  validate(isRequired: boolean) {
    return [
      body("name")
        .if(() => isRequired)
        .notEmpty()
        .withMessage("{PATH} is required")
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 3, max: 50 })
        .withMessage("{PATH} length (min: 3, max: 50)")
        .bail(),

      body("description")
        .if(() => isRequired)
        .notEmpty()
        .withMessage("{PATH} is required")
        .bail()
        .isLength({ min: 50, max: 200 })
        .withMessage("{PATH} length (min: 50, max: 200)")
        .bail(),
    ];
  }

  create() {
    return this.validate(true);
  }

  update() {
    return this.validate(false);
  }
}

export default ProductValidations;
```

### Explanation

1. **`validate` Method**: This method takes a boolean parameter `isRequired` to determine whether the fields should be required or optional.
2. **Conditional Logic**: The `.if(() => isRequired)` method is used to conditionally apply the `.notEmpty()` validation rule based on the value of `isRequired`.
3. **[`create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fproducts%2Fvalidations%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%223bce9500-6277-4e46-8cd4-13e7d6c49197%22%5D "Go to definition") and `update` Methods**: These methods call the `validate` method with `true` and `false` respectively to specify the required or optional nature of the fields.

This approach allows you to maintain a single validation method while differentiating between required and optional fields based on the context (create or update).

Karim-Muhammad: but this i think make update has no validation for length or lie that, right?

GitHub Copilot: You're correct. The previous approach would make the `update` method skip all validations if the fields are optional. To ensure that the `update` method still validates the length and other constraints while making the fields optional, we need to adjust the validation logic.

Here's how you can refactor the [`ProductValidations`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fproducts%2Fvalidations%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22c4321907-9146-4f14-8495-297fd524c4e5%22%5D "Go to definition") class to ensure that the `update` method still validates the length and other constraints:

2. **Conditional Logic**: The `.if(() => isRequired)` method is used to conditionally apply the `.notEmpty()` validation rule based on the value of `isRequired`.

This approach ensures that the `update` method still validates the length and other constraints while making the fields optional.

Karim-Muhammad: but optional is in last chain, is that correct?

GitHub Copilot: You're right. The `.optional()` method should be placed at the beginning of the validation chain to ensure that the subsequent validations are only applied if the field is present.

4. **[`create`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fproducts%2Fvalidations%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%223bce9500-6277-4e46-8cd4-13e7d6c49197%22%5D "Go to definition") and `update` Methods**: These methods call the `validate` method with `true` and `false` respectively to specify the required or optional nature of the fields.

This approach ensures that the `update` method still validates the length and other constraints while making the fields optional.

Karim-Muhammad: @workspace what if i wanted add validations or middleware layer in new resource method in `ApiRouter` how to handel this?

Workspace: To add validations or middleware layers in the [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method of the [`APIRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") class, you can modify the method to accept an optional array of middleware functions. These middleware functions can then be applied to the routes before the controller methods.

Here's how you can modify the [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method in [`src/common/Router.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/common/Router.ts"):

### Updated [`APIRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") Class

```typescript
import { Router, RequestHandler } from "express";
import { ResourceApiController } from "../@types";

class APIRouter {
  private router: Router;

  constructor() {
    this.router = Router();
  }

  resource(
    path: string,
    controller: ResourceApiController,
    middlewares: RequestHandler[] = []
  ) {
    this.router
      .route(path)
      .get(middlewares, controller.read)
      .post(middlewares, controller.create);

    this.router
      .route(`${path}/:id`)
      .get(middlewares, controller.readOne)
      .put(middlewares, controller.update)
      .delete(middlewares, controller.delete);
  }

  getRouter() {
    return this.router;
  }
}

export default APIRouter;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Parameter Addition**: Added an optional `middlewares` parameter to the [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method. This parameter is an array of [`RequestHandler`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Fmiddleware%2Fguard.middleware.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A18%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") functions.
2. **Middleware Application**: Applied the `middlewares` array to each route using the spread operator.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method to add validations or middleware layers:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controller/user.controller";
import UserValidations from "../validations";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import APIRouter from "../../../common/Router";

const router = Router();
const apiRouter = new APIRouter();

apiRouter.resource("/users", UserController, [
  guardMiddleware.adminGuard(),
  UserValidations.getInstance().createUser(),
]);

router.use(apiRouter.getRouter());

export default router;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Middleware Array**: Passed an array of middleware functions ([`guardMiddleware.adminGuard()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fauth%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A33%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%2C%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A11%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`UserValidations.getInstance().createUser()`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fuser%2Froute%2Findex.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition")) to the [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method.
2. **Router Integration**: Used the [`getRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A20%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method to integrate the [`APIRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") instance with the main router.

This approach allows you to add any number of middleware functions to the routes defined by the [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%2252f86f36-71dd-4aea-a2fc-79b296901186%22%5D "Go to definition") method, providing flexibility for adding validations, authentication, or any other middleware logic.

### Updated [`index.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/@types/index.d.ts")

```typescript
import { RequestHandler } from "express";

export type ResourceApiController = {
  all: RequestHandler;
  create: RequestHandler;
  read: RequestHandler;

  getOne: RequestHandler; // Renamed from readOne to getOne
  update: RequestHandler;
  delete: RequestHandler;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Renaming [`readOne`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") to `getOne`**: The [`readOne`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") method has been renamed to `getOne` to provide a more descriptive and intuitive name for handling a single resource.

### Updating the `APIRouter` Class

You will also need to update the `APIRouter` class to use the new method name:

```typescript
import { Router, RequestHandler } from "express";
import { ResourceApiController } from "../@types";

class APIRouter {
  private router: Router;

  constructor() {
    this.router = Router();
  }

  resource(
    path: string,
    controller: ResourceApiController,
    middlewares: RequestHandler[] = []
  ) {
    this.router
      .route(path)
      .get(middlewares, controller.read)
      .post(middlewares, controller.create);

    this.router
      .route(`${path}/:id`)
      .get(middlewares, controller.getOne) // Updated to use getOne
      .put(middlewares, controller.update)
      .delete(middlewares, controller.delete);
  }

  getRouter() {
    return this.router;
  }
}

export default APIRouter;
```

1. **Updating Method Name**: The [`readOne`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") method has been updated to `getOne` in the `APIRouter` class to match the new method name in the [`ResourceApiController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") type.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated `resource` method with the new `getOne` method name:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controller/user.controller";
import UserValidations from "../validations";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import APIRouter from "../../../common/Router";

const router = Router();
const apiRouter = new APIRouter();

apiRouter.resource("/users", UserController, [
  guardMiddleware.adminGuard(),
  UserValidations.getInstance().createUser(),
]);

router.use(apiRouter.getRouter());

export default router;
```

### Explanation

1. **Consistency**: The `UserController` should now have a `getOne` method instead of [`readOne`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") to match the updated [`ResourceApiController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22b276a555-774a-4b7d-b985-7f178f368fa1%22%5D "Go to definition") type.

By making these changes, you ensure that the method for handling a single resource is consistently named `getOne` across your application, making the code more intuitive and easier to understand.

Karim-Muhammad: i want to name method for middleware for all single resources

GitHub Copilot: To name a method for middleware that applies to all single resource routes, you can add a method to the [`ResourceApiController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition") type and update the `APIRouter` class to use this middleware method. Let's call this method `singleResourceMiddleware`.

### Step-by-Step Plan

1. **Update the [`ResourceApiController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition") type** to include the `singleResourceMiddleware` method.
2. **Update the `APIRouter` class** to use the `singleResourceMiddleware` method for all single resource routes.

### Updated [`index.d.ts`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "/run/media/karim/karim/Projects/MERN/ecommerce/server/src/@types/index.d.ts")

```typescript
import { RequestHandler } from "express";

export type ResourceApiController = {
  all: RequestHandler;
  create: RequestHandler;
  read: RequestHandler;

  readOne: RequestHandler;
  update: RequestHandler;
  delete: RequestHandler;

  singleResourceMiddleware?: RequestHandler; // New method for middleware
};
```

### Updated `APIRouter` Class

```typescript
import { Router, RequestHandler } from "express";
import { ResourceApiController } from "../@types";

class APIRouter {
  private router: Router;

  constructor() {
    this.router = Router();
  }

  resource(
    path: string,
    controller: ResourceApiController,
    middlewares: RequestHandler[] = []
  ) {
    const singleResourceMiddleware = controller.singleResourceMiddleware
      ? [controller.singleResourceMiddleware]
      : [];

    this.router
      .route(path)
      .get(middlewares, controller.read)
      .post(middlewares, controller.create);

    this.router
      .route(`${path}/:id`)
      .get([...middlewares, ...singleResourceMiddleware], controller.readOne)
      .put([...middlewares, ...singleResourceMiddleware], controller.update)
      .delete([...middlewares, ...singleResourceMiddleware], controller.delete);
  }

  getRouter() {
    return this.router;
  }
}

export default APIRouter;
```

### Explanation

1. **`singleResourceMiddleware` Method**: Added an optional `singleResourceMiddleware` method to the [`ResourceApiController`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition") type. This method will be used as middleware for all single resource routes.
2. **Middleware Application**: In the `APIRouter` class, the `singleResourceMiddleware` is applied to the single resource routes ([`readOne`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition"), [`update`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition"), and [`delete`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2F%40types%2Findex.d.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%22d338e5b5-2417-4a08-b5d2-ecac8a011790%22%5D "Go to definition")) if it is defined.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated `resource` method with the new `singleResourceMiddleware` method:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controller/user.controller";
import UserValidations from "../validations";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import APIRouter from "../../../common/Router";

const router = Router();
const apiRouter = new APIRouter();

apiRouter.resource(
  "/users",
  {
    ...UserController,
    singleResourceMiddleware: guardMiddleware.adminGuard(),
  },
  [UserValidations.getInstance().createUser()]
);

router.use(apiRouter.getRouter());

export default router;
```

### Explanation

1. **`singleResourceMiddleware`**: The `UserController` now includes the `singleResourceMiddleware` method, which applies the `guardMiddleware.adminGuard()` middleware to all single resource routes.
2. **Router Integration**: The `APIRouter` instance is integrated with the main router, applying the `singleResourceMiddleware` to the appropriate routes.

By making these changes, you ensure that the `singleResourceMiddleware` is consistently applied to all single resource routes, providing a centralized way to handle middleware for these routes.

[ERROR] 13:29:15 TypeError: Router.use() requires a middleware function

GitHub Copilot: The error `TypeError: Router.use() requires a middleware function` indicates that the `Router.use()` method is being called with an invalid argument. This is likely due to the way the middleware arrays are being spread.

To fix this, ensure that the middleware arrays are properly handled and that they default to empty arrays if not provided. Here's the corrected code:

### Corrected Code

```typescript
import { Router, RequestHandler } from "express";
import { ResourceApiController } from "../@types";

class APIRouter {
  private router: Router;

  constructor() {
    this.router = Router();
  }

  resource(
    path: string,
    controller: ResourceApiController,
    middlewares: {
      [method in keyof ResourceApiController]?: RequestHandler[];
    } = {}
  ) {
    this.router.use(...(middlewares["all"] || []));

    this.router
      .route(path)
      .get(...(middlewares["read"] || []), controller.read)
      .post(...(middlewares["create"] || []), controller.create);

    this.router
      .route(`${path}/:id`)
      .all(...(middlewares["all"] || []))
      .get(...(middlewares["readOne"] || []), controller.readOne)
      .put(...(middlewares["update"] || []), controller.update)
      .delete(...(middlewares["delete"] || []), controller.delete);
  }

  getRouter() {
    return this.router;
  }
}

export default APIRouter;
```

### Explanation

1. **Default to Empty Arrays**: Ensure that each middleware array defaults to an empty array if not provided. This prevents the `Router.use()` method from being called with `undefined` or `null`.
2. **Spread Operator**: Use the spread operator correctly to pass the middleware functions to the `Router` methods.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated `resource` method with middleware:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import UserController from "../controller/user.controller";
import UserValidations from "../validations";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import APIRouter from "../../../common/Router";

const router = Router();
const apiRouter = new APIRouter();

apiRouter.resource("/users", UserController, {
  all: [guardMiddleware.adminGuard()],
  create: [UserValidations.getInstance().createUser()],
  readOne: [UserValidations.getInstance().readUser()],
  update: [UserValidations.getInstance().updateUser()],
  delete: [UserValidations.getInstance().deleteUser()],
});

router.use(apiRouter.getRouter());

export default router;
```

### Explanation

1. **Middleware Arrays**: Middleware functions are provided for each route as arrays.
2. **Router Integration**: The [`APIRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A37%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%222504ea54-0218-409d-a0a0-311f98932725%22%5D "Go to definition") instance is integrated with the main router, applying the middleware functions to the appropriate routes.

By making these changes, you ensure that the `Router.use()` method is called with valid middleware functions, preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring that the middleware is correctly applied to the routes.

Karim-Muhammad: request /category is hanging, not go to controller and return response, still haning

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be due to the way the middleware is being applied. Specifically, the `this.router.use(...middlewares["all"]);` line might be causing the router to hang if the middleware does not call `next()`. Additionally, the way the middleware arrays are being spread might be causing issues.

Let's ensure that the middleware is correctly applied and that the `next()` function is called within the middleware. Here's the corrected code:

### Corrected Code

```typescript
import { RequestHandler, Router } from "express";
import { ResourceApiController } from "../@types";

class APIRouter {
  private router: Router;

  constructor() {
    this.router = Router();
  }

  resource(
    path: string,
    controller: ResourceApiController,
    middlewares: {
      [method in keyof ResourceApiController]?: RequestHandler[];
    } = {}
  ) {
    const applyMiddlewares = (handlers: RequestHandler[] = []) => {
      return handlers.map(
        (handler) => (req, res, next) => handler(req, res, next)
      );
    };

    this.router
      .route(path)
      .get(...applyMiddlewares(middlewares["read"]), controller.read)
      .post(...applyMiddlewares(middlewares["create"]), controller.create);

    this.router
      .route(`${path}/:id`)
      .get(...applyMiddlewares(middlewares["readOne"]), controller.readOne)
      .put(...applyMiddlewares(middlewares["update"]), controller.update)
      .delete(...applyMiddlewares(middlewares["delete"]), controller.delete);
  }

  getRouter() {
    return this.router;
  }
}

export default APIRouter;
```

### Explanation

1. **`applyMiddlewares` Function**: This function ensures that each middleware calls `next()`. It wraps each middleware handler to ensure that `next()` is called.
2. **Middleware Application**: The `applyMiddlewares` function is used to apply the middleware arrays to the routes.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated [`resource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%2C%228e23ce8b-caeb-4750-9c0c-a8582ba6dba3%22%5D "Go to definition") method with middleware:

```typescript
import { Router } from "express";
import CategoryController from "../controller/category.controller";
import CategoryValidations from "../validations";
import guardMiddleware from "../../auth/middleware/guard.middleware";
import APIRouter from "../../../common/Router";

const router = Router();
const apiRouter = new APIRouter();

apiRouter.resource("/categories", CategoryController, {
  read: [guardMiddleware.adminGuard()],
  create: [CategoryValidations.getInstance().createCategory()],
  readOne: [CategoryValidations.getInstance().readCategory()],
  update: [CategoryValidations.getInstance().updateCategory()],
  delete: [CategoryValidations.getInstance().deleteCategory()],
});

router.use(apiRouter.getRouter());

export default router;
```

### Explanation

1. **Middleware Arrays**: Middleware functions are provided for each route as arrays.
2. **Router Integration**: The [`APIRouter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Fcommon%2FRouter.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%228e23ce8b-caeb-4750-9c0c-a8582ba6dba3%22%5D "Go to definition") instance is integrated with the main router, applying the middleware functions to the appropriate routes.

By making these changes, you ensure that the middleware functions are correctly applied and that `next()` is called, preventing the router from hanging and ensuring that the request is properly handled by the controller.

Karim-Muhammad: this hook doesn't run when i Mode.create

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be due to the way Mongoose handles hooks and the `Model.create` method. The [`pre('save')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hook is not triggered when using `Model.create`. Instead, you should use [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") or [`pre('save')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hooks on the schema level to ensure that the hook runs correctly.

Here's how you can modify your hook to ensure it runs when using `Model.create`:

### Updated Code

```typescript
import slugify from "slugify";
import BrandSchema from "./schema";

// Use pre('validate') to ensure the hook runs on both create and save
BrandSchema.pre("validate", function (next) {
  console.log("pre validate hook");
  if (this.isModified("name")) {
    this.slug = slugify(this.name, { lower: true });
  }

  next();
});
```

### Explanation

1. **[`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") Hook**: The [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hook is triggered before the document is validated, ensuring that it runs for both `Model.create` and `Model.save`.
2. **`this.isModified("name")` Check**: This check ensures that the slug is only generated if the [`name`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") field is modified.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated schema with the [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hook:

```typescript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import BrandSchema from "./schema";

const Brand = mongoose.model("Brand", BrandSchema);

async function createBrand() {
  const brand = await Brand.create({ name: "Example Brand" });
  console.log(brand);
}

createBrand().catch(console.error);
```

### Explanation

1. **Model Creation**: The `Brand.create` method is used to create a new document. The [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hook ensures that the slug is generated before the document is validated and saved.
2. **Logging**: The created brand document is logged to the console, showing the generated slug.

By using the [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fbrands%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%7D%5D%2C%220452e36e-549b-4663-9b52-07aaac125575%22%5D "Go to definition") hook, you ensure that the hook runs correctly when using `Model.create`, preventing issues with the hook not being triggered.

Karim-Muhammad: "Error: Validation failed: name: First argument to `Model` constructor must be an object, **not** a string. Make sure you're calling `mongoose.model()`, not `mongoose.Model()`.\n at Function.internal (/run/media/karim/

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that there is an issue with how the `this.model("Category")` method is being called within the validation function. This is likely due to the context ([`this`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition")) not being correctly bound to the document instance.

To fix this, you can use the `mongoose` module directly to access the [`Category`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") model within the validation function. Here's the corrected code:

### Corrected Code

```typescript
import slugify from "slugify";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import CategorySchema from "./schema";

CategorySchema.pre("validate", function (next) {
  if (this.isModified("name")) {
    this.slug = slugify(this.name, { lower: true });
  }

  next();
});

CategorySchema.path("name").validate({
  validator: async function (value) {
    const Category = mongoose.model("Category");

    const isNameExist = await Category.countDocuments({
      name: value,
    });

    if (isNameExist) return false;

    if (this.isModified("name")) this.slug = slugify(value, { lower: true });

    return true;
  },

  message: "Category name already exists!",
});
```

### Explanation

1. **Import `mongoose`**: Import the `mongoose` module to access the [`Category`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") model directly.
2. **Access [`Category`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") Model**: Use `mongoose.model("Category")` to access the [`Category`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") model within the validation function. This ensures that the correct model is used, regardless of the context ([`this`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition")).

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the updated schema with the [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") hook and the custom validation:

```typescript
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import CategorySchema from "./schema";

const Category = mongoose.model("Category", CategorySchema);

async function createCategory() {
  try {
    const category = await Category.create({ name: "Example Category" });
    console.log(category);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}

createCategory();
```

### Explanation

1. **Model Creation**: The `Category.create` method is used to create a new document. The [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") hook ensures that the slug is generated before the document is validated and saved.
2. **Logging**: The created category document is logged to the console, showing the generated slug.
3. **Error Handling**: Errors are caught and logged to the console, providing feedback if the validation fails.

By making these changes, you ensure that the validation function correctly accesses the [`Category`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A28%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") model and that the [`pre('validate')`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition") hook runs as expected, preventing issues with the context ([`this`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Frun%2Fmedia%2Fkarim%2Fkarim%2FProjects%2FMERN%2Fecommerce%2Fserver%2Fsrc%2Ffeatures%2Fcategory%2Fmodels%2Fhooks.ts%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A4%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%2C%22462e636a-70b6-4778-95e1-307ff2253358%22%5D "Go to definition")) not being correctly bound.
